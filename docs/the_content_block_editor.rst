Importing Content Blocks From Another Object
--------------------------------------------

.. todo:: Insert screenshot of empty content block editor here.

If you have created content blocks for another object, you can easily import them when adding new objects of the same type. Before adding any content blocks, choose the object you want to import from and press the `Import Content Blocks` button. The draft content blocks from the chosen object are cloned and added to the new object ready for you to edit the content.

This feature allows you to quickly create pages with the same layout of content blocks.

Drafts, Publishing, and Previews
---------------------------------

All content blocks are saved as drafts. These drafts are used for previews. Only after you have published the content blocks, with the `Publish` button, will the updates show on your website.

You can reset all content blocks to their published state with the `Reset` button.
